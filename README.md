## Technologies

HTML5:
- HTML was used to define the basic structure of the site. Utilising standard HTML elements such as Divs, Unordered and Ordered lists and Paragraphs.

CSS3:
- Cascading Style Sheets were used to style the pages of the sites by using user created and exisint Bootstrap classes.

Bootstrap 4: (https://getbootstrap.com
- Bootstrap 4 was used to help structure the rown and columns for the Bootstrap grid on the Skills page. It was also utilised for the Contact form on the contacts page, to allow the form fields to stack on top of each other at smaller screen sizes.

Google Fonts: (https://fonts.google.com/)
- Was used for the 3 fonts used in the website for the body and headings. 

Font Awesome: (https://fontawesome.com/)
- FA was used to add icons on the Skills page for the Support and Development section headings. It was also utilised for the Github and LinkedIn social links in the footer.

Atom: (https://atom.io/)
- I used Atom as my editing environment as I like the ability to customise it to aid my worklfow through adding Atom packages to the editor.

Git / Github: (https://git-scm.com / https://github.com/)
- I utilised Git and Github to control and commit  changes made to the site using the Github package in Atom and the Git command line in macOS Terminal.


## Testing

I have tested the site on a multitude of different devices and sizes. This includes a 5K 27" iMac, 13' MacBook Pro, the MBP connected up to a 1080P External Monitor, an 11.9" iPad, an iPad Mini and iPhone 4, 5S, 6 and 7, along with a Samsung Galaxy J3.
The site has also been tested on the folowing browsers: Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera and Brave.  The developer tools on all browsers were used to check responsive and test the site on the various device sizes the inspector offers.
I have asked a few friends and family to test the site site and make sure they can navigate it easily and to report back with any iossues.

The links have been tested and all open in new tabs within the same browser as the site. On the Contacts page all fields will need to be filled in to submit. The email field will need a valid email address to clear the validation.. 

Had an issue where the timeline elements were stretched to wide on high resolution screens. This was fixed by using a media query to change the width of the timeline content on the higher resolution screens.
